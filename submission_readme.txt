Submission README for: Raymarching Fractals and Volumes
By: Alec Neiman (afn343)

This program was written in Rust and needs to be compiled into webassembly in order to run.
In order to run this project, you can either compile this yourself, by installing the rust-wasm crate and running the
npm commands in the README.md, or by running a webserver over the included pre-compiled version of this project
located in the ./dist folder.

The writeup for this project is located at "./graphics final report.pdf"

I completed the UT course instructor survey for this class.

The repository for this project is publicly hosted at https://github.com/rbneiman/raymarching_final
